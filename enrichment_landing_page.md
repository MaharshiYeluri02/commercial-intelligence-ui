#### **Section 2: The Clinical Data Chasm**

##### **Better Targeting Starts Here**

*   **Intro Paragraph:** Claims data suffers with capture rate for key events like **Treatments, Mutations, Diagnosis, Lab Results** and other key events despite having good patient coverage. EHR data like **Tempus, Flatiron** has the coverage problem. We bridge the gap of patient coverage and event capture rate to help with your targeting. We specialise in **complex oncology** and **biopharmaceutical portfolios**.

##### **The Claims Data Problem: Good Coverage, Poor Event Capture**

*   **Body Paragraph:** Claims data offers excellent patient coverage—tracking millions of patients across the healthcare system. However, it suffers with capture rate for the key clinical events that drive precision targeting decisions.

##### **Illustration 2: Claims Data - Coverage vs. Capture Comparison**

*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Type:** Side-by-side horizontal bar chart
    *   **Left Bar:** "Patient Coverage" - 95% filled (green), labeled "Excellent: ~95% of patients captured"
    *   **Right Bar:** "Event Capture Rate" - 15% filled (red), labeled "Poor: ~15% of key events captured"
    *   **Gap Visualization:** Large red arrow or warning icon between bars with text "THE GAP"
    *   **Below Chart:** Icon grid showing 5 event types (Mutations, Treatments, Labs, Diagnosis, Other Events) - 1-2 out of 10 icons lit per row

*   **Missing Key Events:**
    *   🧬 **Mutations:** Test orders visible, but results (PIK3CA, BRCA, EGFR) not captured
    *   💊 **Treatments:** Treatments prescribed, but outcomes and response not tracked
    *   📊 **Lab Results:** Lab tests ordered, but clinical values and biomarker outcomes missing
    *   🎯 **Diagnosis:** Disease codes present, but staging and progression unclear
    *   📈 **Other Key Events:** Treatment switches, progression events, adverse events poorly captured

##### **Illustration 3: Claims Data Event Capture Breakdown**

*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Type:** Stacked horizontal bar chart with 5 rows
    *   **Rows (Events):** Mutations | Treatments | Lab Results | Diagnosis | Other Events
    *   **Each Bar:** Split into "Captured" (filled) vs "Missing" (empty/gray)
        *   Mutations: 12% captured (red), 88% missing (gray)
        *   Treatments: 25% captured (orange), 75% missing (gray)
        *   Lab Results: 10% captured (red), 90% missing (gray)
        *   Diagnosis: 30% captured (yellow), 70% missing (gray)
        *   Other Events: 18% captured (red), 82% missing (gray)
    *   **Title:** "What's Missing in Claims Data?"
    *   **Annotation:** Overall average: ~15-20% event capture rate

##### **The EHR Data Problem: Rich Detail, Limited Coverage**

*   **Body Paragraph:** EHR data like **Tempus, Flatiron** has the coverage problem—rich clinical detail but limited to select sites and practices, creating geographic and demographic blind spots.

##### **Illustration 4: EHR Data - Coverage vs. Capture Comparison**

*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Type:** Side-by-side horizontal bar chart (mirror of Illustration 2)
    *   **Left Bar:** "Patient Coverage" - 10% filled (red), labeled "Limited: ~10% of patients captured"
    *   **Right Bar:** "Event Capture Rate" - 90% filled (green), labeled "Excellent: ~90% of key events captured"
    *   **Gap Visualization:** Large red arrow or warning icon between bars with text "THE GAP"
    *   **Below Chart:** Icon grid showing 5 event types - 9 out of 10 icons lit per row

*   **Coverage Limitations:**
    *   🏥 **Limited Sites:** Only specific cancer centers and participating practices
    *   📍 **Geographic Gaps:** Major blind spots in coverage areas
    *   ⏱️ **Data Freshness:** Delayed availability and slower refresh cycles
    *   💰 **High Cost:** Expensive per covered patient

##### **Illustration 5: EHR Data Event Capture Breakdown**

*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Type:** Stacked horizontal bar chart with 5 rows (mirror of Illustration 3)
    *   **Rows (Events):** Mutations | Treatments | Lab Results | Diagnosis | Other Events
    *   **Each Bar:** Split into "Captured" (filled) vs "Missing" (empty/gray)
        *   Mutations: 92% captured (green), 8% missing (gray)
        *   Treatments: 88% captured (green), 12% missing (gray)
        *   Lab Results: 94% captured (green), 6% missing (gray)
        *   Diagnosis: 85% captured (green), 15% missing (gray)
        *   Other Events: 82% captured (green), 18% missing (gray)
    *   **Title:** "Rich Detail in EHR Data - But Limited Reach"
    *   **Annotation:** Overall average: ~85-90% event capture rate

##### **The Targeting Challenge: Two Incomplete Pictures**

##### **Illustration 6: Side-by-Side Comparison Summary**

*   **Visual Description:**
    *   **Type:** Comparison table with visual indicators
    *   **Layout:** Two columns (Claims Data | EHR Data) with 6 rows
    *   **Rows:**
        1. **Patient Coverage:** Large checkmark ✅ | Red X ❌
        2. **Event Capture:** Red X ❌ | Large checkmark ✅
        3. **Mutations Visible:** 12% (red gauge) | 92% (green gauge)
        4. **Treatments Captured:** 25% (orange gauge) | 88% (green gauge)
        5. **Lab Results:** 10% (red gauge) | 94% (green gauge)
        6. **Overall Targeting Capability:** ⚠️ Incomplete | ⚠️ Incomplete
    *   **Bottom Row (Spanning both columns):** 
        *   Large red banner: "Neither Source Alone Enables Effective Targeting"
        *   Sub-text: "Too broad (wasted resources) OR Too narrow (missed opportunities)"

*   **The Problem:** 
    *   **Claims Data:** You see millions of patients but can't identify the right ones to target
    *   **EHR Data:** You see rich clinical detail but only for a fraction of the market
    *   **Impact:** Either targeting too broadly (wasted resources) or too narrowly (missed opportunities)
